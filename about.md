Hi guys!
I'm Tamara and I've been working as a Data Scientist for almost 2 years here in Belgrade, Serbia.
I graduated from Faculty of Organization Sciences (CS) in September,2019.
I'm entitled to believe that I'm quite a data scientist specialized in data quality and data preprocessing because I think this is the major step in every DS process and the specialization in this burning and dynamic field is quite necessary to become "above-average". I am also open-minded to explore the other DS fields, especially stunning world of deep learning. I will try to cover many various topics mainly in order to _learning-by-doing_ for myself and potentially to help others to discover the hidden treasure of DS.
